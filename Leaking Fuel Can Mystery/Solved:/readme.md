When I had waste vegetable oil stored in 5 gallon Plastic Fuel Cans, the oil leaked out from the top!

# Cause: Hot Expanding Air Pressure
Hot Expanding Air at the Top is pushing down the Oil and causing it to overflow out of the spout!
The spout is sitting in the can, submerged in oil, and while the lid is tight the only place the pressure has to exit is out the spout - in reverse!

# Solution:
1. Store it with the Spout on and pointed up!
2. Make a spacer Leave a small gap between the lid and the spout
3. Use an airtight Cover Cap over the spout. Most cans come with this.
